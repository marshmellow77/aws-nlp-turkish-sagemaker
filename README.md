# Solving NLP (Natural Language Processing) Problems with HuggingFace Library on AWS for Turkish Language

**AI Powered NLP Trends**
The decade-old field of natural language processing (NLP) is experiencing a fascinating renaissance, and researchers are finally able to train complex deep learning models on very large text datasets, in order to solve business problems such as question answering, sentence comparison, or text summarization. In this respect, the Transformer deep learning architecture has proven very successful, and has spawned several state of the art model families such as BERT, T5, GPT. As amazing as these models are, training and optimizing them remains a challenging endeavor that requires a significant amount of time, resources, and skills. 

**Hugging Face**
Hugging Face, founded in 2016, is a startup that makes it easy to add state of the art Transformer models to your AI/ML applications. Thanks to their popular libraries, one can download and predict with over 7,000 pre-trained models in 164 languages. 
 
**NLP on AWS**
AWS offers the broadest and deepest set of machine learning services and supporting cloud infrastructure, putting machine learning in the hands of every developer, data scientist and expert practitioner. Tens of thousands of customers use Amazon SageMaker, our fully managed service for machine learning.

In this session, we will make a demo on how to fine-tune Hugging Face models on Amazon SageMaker for an NLP task using a public dataset.

# Target Audience
Software developers, solutions architects, product managers with experience in Data Science and Machine Learning for NLP Domain. Knowledge of Transformer Architecture is recommended but not required.

# Prerequisites

You could run the demo on your AWS Account using AWS SageMaker. 

# Use Case & Dataset
In this demo, we will use a Turkish language model created by the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State Library (https://github.com/stefan-it/turkish-bert). We will use the Hugging Face Model Hub to download the model (https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-uncased) and then fine-tune it to 2 very different tasks:

* Sentiment Analysis
* Question Answering
